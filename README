## Todo

- associate users with employee somehow (avoid extending model)
- make sure when adding/editing/deleting entries, that the user has permissions to perform the actions
- implement different user levels
- make / direct to /entries (research best way to do this)
- make logout view not user django-admin's logout template
- implement delete on entries
